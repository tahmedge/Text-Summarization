# Diversity Driven Attention Model without Augmented Training Data.

No augmented training data is used by modifying [helper_function](https://github.com/tahmedge/Text-Summarization/blob/master/DDA_Original/models/basic_files/dataset_iterator.py). Instruction to run the script can be found in the original [original implementation](https://github.com/PrekshaNema25/DiverstiyBasedAttentionMechanism/blob/master/models/basic_files/dataset_iterator.py). Only [helper_function](https://github.com/tahmedge/Text-Summarization/blob/master/DDA_Original/models/basic_files/dataset_iterator.py) is different here than the original implementation.
